Release Process
====================

Before every release candidate:

* Update translations (ping wumpus on IRC) see [translation_process.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md#synchronising-translations).

* Update manpages, see [gen-manpages.sh](https://github.com/deeponion/deeponion/blob/master/contrib/devtools/README.md#gen-manpagessh).

Before every minor and major release:

* Update [bips.md](bips.md) to account for changes since the last release.
* Update version in `configure.ac` (don't forget to set `CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `true`)
* Write release notes (see below)
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` nMinimumChainWork with information from the getblockchaininfo rpc.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` defaultAssumeValid  with information from the getblockhash rpc.
  - The selected value must not be orphaned so it may be useful to set the value two blocks back from the tip.
  - Testnet should be set some tens of thousands back from the tip due to reorgs there.
  - This update should be reviewed with a reindex-chainstate with assumevalid=0 to catch any defect
     that causes rejection of blocks in the past history.

Before every major release:

* Update hardcoded [seeds](/contrib/seeds/README.md), see [this pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7415) for an example.
* Update [`BLOCK_CHAIN_SIZE`](/src/qt/intro.cpp) to the current size plus some overhead.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` chainTxData with statistics about the transaction count and rate.
* Update version of `contrib/gitian-descriptors/*.yml`: usually one'd want to do this on master after branching off the release - but be sure to at least do it before a new major release
